<!-- Update XX, Y with major and minor versions --> 
Conversations on this thread are limited to 0.XX releases major issues and backport (cherry-pick) requests from commits that are already on master.

An example of a good such request is a bug fix for a serious issue that has been merged into master but did not make the 0.XX.Y cut, with a link to the specific commit hash on main with the commit to cherry-pick, like this example link: facebook/react-native@bd2b7d6

In other words, if you cannot point to a particular commit on master, then your request likely belongs as a new issue in http://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues.
